## Install Preparations

### Deployment Methods
You can use our `docker-compose.yaml` file to quickly start with the Mata Elang Platform. We already automate the process, and you only need to change some configurations. 

If you want to try all components in the same host, you can try to check in the `all-in-one` folder.

> :warning: This default deployment is not recommended for production. You always need to review and change the configuration based on your needs and hardware resources. You still need to secure your environment and configure a firewall before deploying it to the public.
